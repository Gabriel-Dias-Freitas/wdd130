I enjoyng play video games, watch movies, animes, draw, write and read books. I'm studying web development on BYU Idaho ensign college troughth Pathway Connect. I also want to study on a presencial college here in Brasília to complement my studies. After I have some knowledge on web development I want to work on a internship and look for a programming language to specialize in and start working in a company or as a freelancer depending on what works best for me. I have experience with team work and also working in an office.
